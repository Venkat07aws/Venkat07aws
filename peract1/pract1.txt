El Tatio is a geothermal field with many geysers located in the
Andes of northern Chile at 4,320 metres (14,170 ft) above sea level. 
It is the third-largest geyser field in the world and the largest 
in the Southern Hemisphere. The geothermal field has many geysers,
hot springs, and associated sinter deposits. The vents are sites of populations
of extremophile microorganisms such as hyperthermophiles, and have been studied as
an analogue for the early Earth and possible past life on Mars. El Tatio lies at
the western foot of a series of stratovolcanoes, part of the Central Volcanic Zone and the Altiplanoâ€“Puna volcanic
 complex, which may be the source of heat for El Tatio. There are no recorded eruptions of the Tatio volcanoes. 
 The field is a major tourism destination. It has been prospected for geothermal power production, but development ceased
  after a major incident in 2009 when a drilling well blew out.....
